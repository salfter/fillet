This fork adds a couple of scripts to make fillet.py easier to use:

1) hex2wifaddr.py converts hexadecimal private keys to WIF private keys and
   addresses.  Unlike pywallet.py, it has minimal dependencies (no bsddb, no
   ecdsa, etc.).  For the purposes for which we need it, it's also a fair bit
   faster.  It's mostly cribbed from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=23241.0.
   I've never really done anything much with Python, so odds are good that the
   parts I've written may be suboptimal.
2) getkey.sh wraps all this up into an easy-to-use utility to retrieve a 
   particular deterministic key, given a file and an index (>0).  You can
   retrieve either the address or the private key.  If you have ImageMagick
   and qrencode installed (and have an X server running), you can have it 
   pop up a QR code.
