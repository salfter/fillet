This fork adds a couple of scripts to make fillet.py easier to use:

1) hex2wifaddr.py converts hexadecimal private keys to WIF private keys and
   addresses.  Unlike pywallet.py, it has minimal dependencies (no bsddb, no
   ecdsa, etc.).  For the purposes for which we need it, it's also a fair bit
   faster.  It's mostly cribbed from https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=23241.0.
   I've never really done anything much with Python, so odds are good that the
   parts I've written may be suboptimal.

2) getkey.sh wraps all this up into an easy-to-use utility to retrieve a 
   particular deterministic key, given a file and an index (>0).  You can
   retrieve either the address or the private key.  If you have ImageMagick
   and qrencode installed (and have an X server running), you can have it 
   pop up a QR code.

3) Support for Litecoin addresses has been added.  If I knew more about
   Python and its implementation of getopt, I would've just fixed
   hex2wifaddr.py to support both Bitcoin and Litecoin.  Instead, I took the
   easy route and created hex2wifaddr_ltc.py.  diff will indicate what
   little needed changing (hint: the prefix for private hex keys is 0x80 for
   Bitcoin and 0xB0 for Litecoin, and the network version is 0x00 for
   Bitcoin and 0x30 for Litecoin).
